The experiments were realized at the [Cloudlab Testbed](https://www.cloudlab.us/) using a 24 node topology making use of bare metal servers. The topology profile can be found [here](https://www.cloudlab.us/show-profile.php?uuid=999fe067-bf91-11ed-b28b-e4434b2381fc).

Detailed information and instructions on initializing the topology on Cloudlab can be found [here](https://github.com/ufukusubutun/Reordering_Switch/blob/main/docs/topology.md).


## Trace-Generation
