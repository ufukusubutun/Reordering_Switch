## Experiment Profile

The experiments were realized at the [Cloudlab Testbed](https://www.cloudlab.us/) using a 24 node topology making use of bare metal servers. Cludlab provides extensive documentation and guides to get started [here](http://docs.cloudlab.us/).


You can use the following Cloudlab profile to instantiate the 24 node topology used for the experiments with a couple of clicks.
https://www.cloudlab.us/show-profile.php?uuid=999fe067-bf91-11ed-b28b-e4434b2381fc

The topology comes built in with a temporary 120 GB storage (that is wiped at the completion of the reservation.) This storage is built under `/mydata`.






### Advanced 

The topology also allows you to attach a permanent storage (termed long term dataset in Cloudlab jargon.) To have access to a long term dataset create your own dataset under Storage > Create Dataset and enter the URN address when instantiating the topolgy using the provided profile. This storage will be built in under `/mypermdata`.
